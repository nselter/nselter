I am a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of the People with a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship. I have two years of experience in software development with a diverse portfolio of projects from things like chess game creation to various programs for my TikTok LIVE endeavors. 

I am a co-founder of a successful live-streaming business venture through TikTok LIVE, demonstrating adeptness in time management, self-accountability, and salesmanship. I started this business in March 2023 and have been doing daily livestreams ever since. Within the first year of streaming, we grew our main channel, @popcornbattle, to 1.3 million followers and have become a top streamer on the platform.

Before live-streaming on TikTok, I studied freshman year at UC Santa Cruz for a different experience and to become more well-rounded. After I transferred to an online college called the University of the People so that I could learn at my pace and have more time to dedicate to streaming.

As the eldest of five siblings, I prioritize family values and responsibility, trying to be the best role model for my younger siblings. One thing you should know about me is that I am always looking to try new things and have new experiences. Long term, my goal is to build software that is meaningful and has a positive impact on the world.
